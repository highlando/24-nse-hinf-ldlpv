  abstract  = {The framework of Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems concerns linear dynamical systems whose state-space representations depend on exogenous nonstationary parameters. Since its introduction by Shamma and Athans in 1988 to model gain-scheduling, the LPV paradigm has become a standard formalism in systems and controls, with many papers devoted to analysis, controller synthesis, and system identification of LPV models. This chapter reviews basic concepts and presents a representative selection of analytical approaches for LPV systems.},
